A simple Java program that decrypts a fixed encrypted message using the Vigenère Cipher.

## ✅ The Decrypted Message

**welcome to thirty day dev challenge!**

## 🧠 Explanation

- The program contains a hardcoded encrypted message:  
  `cmejink bh abjxbr kuz jmo jbbrtxuaf!`
- It asks the user to enter the decryption key.
- The Vigenère cipher decryption subtracts each key letter's shift from the encrypted message.
- Non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation) are left unchanged.
